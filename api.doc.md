## Conventions

- **Base path:** all endpoints are prefixed with `/api/v1`.
- **Auth legend:**
  - **JWT** — requires `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` (`Depends(get_current_user)`).
  - **Public** — no auth (OAuth callbacks carry context via a `state` nonce; webhooks via signature/verify token).
  - **Permission-gated** — JWT **plus** an RBAC check (`check_permission(module, action)` / `require_permission`) or a role restriction (e.g. *Super Admin only*), noted per row.
- **Response envelope:** successful responses are wrapped by `success_response(...)`
  (`utils/response.py`), so payloads live under `data`. The frontend reads `response.data.data`.
- **Interactive docs:** `GET /docs` and `GET /redoc` are served **only when `DEBUG=true`**.
- **Health:** `GET /api/v1/health` (public).
- **Static:** uploaded files are served at `GET /uploads/<filename>` (publicly reachable).

### Frontend client behaviour ([frontend/lib/axios.ts](frontend/lib/axios.ts))
- Bearer token read from `localStorage.access_token` on every request; also mirrored to a
  7-day `access_token` cookie (used by Next.js middleware for SSR route protection).
- On `401`, a single-flight refresh calls `POST /auth/refresh`; concurrent 401s queue and
  replay with the new token. Refresh failure clears auth and redirects to `/login`.
- **†** = hook uses a raw `fetch` wrapper (manual bearer, **no** auto-refresh) instead of the axios instance.

## Where the API is used — summary

- **Frontend (Next.js)** is the primary consumer. Each backend area maps to one hook in
  [frontend/hooks/](frontend/hooks/) (see the index table above); hooks are composed into
  the pages under `app/(dashboard)/`. Cross-cutting areas (`/auth`, `/notifications`,
  `/sync`, `/analytics`, `/board-statuses`) are consumed by shared components rather than a
  single page.
- **External services call in** to: OAuth callbacks (`/connectors/{platform}/callback`),
  Stripe (`/billing/webhook`), and Meta (`/webhooks/*`).
- **Programmatic access** is available via API keys (`/api-keys`) authenticated through the
  `authenticate_api_key` helper.
- **Public (no-auth) endpoints:** `/health`, `/auth/{register,login,refresh,forgot-password,reset-password,sso-login}`,
  `/reports/shared/{share_token}`, `/billing/plans`, all OAuth callbacks, and all webhooks.
- **Not currently reachable from the UI:** `/kpi-targets/*` (hook exists, no page) and
  `/billing/*` (page redirects to dashboard).

For the WebSocket, hooks-that-bypass-axios (†), and store details, see
[frontend/lib/axios.ts](frontend/lib/axios.ts) and [frontend/stores/authStore.ts](frontend/stores/authStore.ts).
